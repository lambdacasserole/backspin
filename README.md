# Backspin
Bit flipping/manipulation Maven package for Java.

When it comes to getting down and dirty with ones and zeroes, it's easy to get lost in a sea of bitwise operators. Backspin is a minimal bit manipulation library that allows you to deal in raw binary digits without ever typing '&' or '|' (unless you want to, of course).

Perhaps you're writing your own Huffman compression stuff and you need to deal with bit sequences, perhaps you're dealing with an obscure [P4 type portable bitmap file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm_format) or maybe you just want to get your binary arithmetic on. Changes are, backspin has what you need.

## Contributing
For most intents and purposes, Backspin is considered to fulfil its original use case. Bug fixes and suggestions are welcome, however, from any member of the community.
